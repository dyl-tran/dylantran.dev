# ðŸ’» Portfolio Website

dylantran.dev is a personal website that I created to showcase my projects and skills. It is built using Three.js to utilize 3D models, bundled with Vite.js, and deployed using Vercel.

> * Maintained by: `Dylan Tran`

### Technology Overview

* Used Three.js to export 3D model of developer's room and create a 3D scene
* Used Vite.js features to create a development server and bundle the project.
* Used Vercel for website deployment and free hosting

### Devices
* The app can be properly viewed on the desktop, iPad in landscape mode, and on mobile phones.

## Lessons Learned
  1. Learned the basics of 3D models in Blender and the Three.js library:
     * Learned how to create a 3D model of a room in Blender
     * Learned how to export the 3D model as a .glb file
     * Learned how to import the .glb file into Three.js and create a 3D scene
  2. Three.js concepts such as
        * Scene
        * Camera
        * Renderer
        * GSAP 3.0
        * Material
        * Light
        * Texture
        * Animation
  3. Learned how to use Vite.js for the backend in order to hot-reload code.
